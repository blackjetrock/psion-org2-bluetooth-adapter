Errata for Psion Organiser II Bluetooth Adapter
===============================================

1. Add a serial eeprom to store persistant info like BT IDs to connect to.
   Pico flash is fine, but may wear out faster than eeprom and be less
   replaceable  (more of a problem really).
2. Change supply so input goes to dc-dc converter to 6V or so then 5V
   regulator and then to battery charger IC. Charger IC has battery attached.
   Output from battery charger/power path goes to Pico which supplies 3V3
   using its buck-boost conbverter.
3. Allow 5V input from USB connector so power pack can be used as input
4. Swap to ETA6002 as the footprint is better for hand soldering.
